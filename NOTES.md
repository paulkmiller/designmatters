#Notes to Self

* Don't jump back and forth too much, take advantage of two-column in sublime
* Leave plenty of room for questions
* Don't forget to take breaks
* For most lab times it is best to start with a short code-along to exhibit the concepts
* Having code samples in slides is NOT the same as a live code-along
