##Image Paths

Three ways to write them

* Relative
* Absolute
* Full

--

##Image Paths
Relative Path

![](../img/folder-structure.png)

*	Inside ```webroot```, a relative path could be used:

####```<img src="images/logo.png">```

--

##Image Paths
Relative Path

![Parent Folder Structure](../img/folder-structure.png)

####```<img src="../images/logo.png">```

Note:

* Given this folder structure the same image would be ```<img src="../images/logo.png">``
*
Note that ```..``` means to go up a directory, and can be used repeatedly: `../..` would go up two directories.


--

##Image Paths

Absolute Path

```<img src="/images/logo.png">```

Note:
	Absolute URLs start with a `/`, so if we imagine that our `webroot` directory was stored on a server such that the `webroot/index.html` file is accessible at `http://example.com/index.html`, then placing the logo image could be done from any html page with: ```<img src="/images/logo.png">```

The benefit here is that this same ```src``` path works on any html page, no matter what its location, so the same ```img``` tag can be used on both the ```webroot/index.html``` page and the ```webroot/about/index.html``` page.

The downside is that the path only works if the project is stored to a proper location for serving.


--


##Image Paths
Full URL

		<img src="http://www.website.com/images/some_image.png">

Note:
For linking to images, make sure that you have permission to use the image in this way. Even then, it is often better to host a copy of the same image, rather than link to another server, because it reduces dependency.


---

##Image File Formats

There are three main image file formats:

--

##Image File Formats

####.png

*	Can have full levels of transparency
* High quality

![png transparency](../img/unit_1/smiley.png)

Note:
Supports transparency and semi-transparency, great for logos, icons, and repeating background tiles. Almost always preferable to a `gif`, unless semi-transparency is not needed, and the `gif` format is significantly smaller.

--

##Image File Formats


####.gif

*	Can have basic transparency, typically a `png` is used instead.
* Can be animated!

![gif transparency](../img/unit_1/smiley.gif)
![gif animated](../img/unit_1/animated.gif)

--

##Image File Formats

####.jpeg

* Best file size, can choose quality
* No transparency

![jpg transparency](../img/unit_1/smiley.jpg)

Note:
No transparency, can be stored at different compression levels with varying amounts of "lossy-ness", typically the best format for photos. (Try to balance between photo quality and file size.)

##CSS Placement

Where can CSS go?

* Inline
* In the `head`
* *In a separate file*


Note:
CSS should go in a separate file. We're going to start by placing them in the head for convenience and to learn the syntax. We'll show inline styles at the end, just to demonstrate.

--

##CSS Placement

###Inline

```<p style="color:red; font-weight:bold;"></p>```

--

##CSS Placement

###In the `head`

```
<head>
	<style>
		p {
			color: red;
			font-weight: bold;
		}
	</style>
</head>
```

--

##CSS Placement

###Using a separate CSS file

####This is best practice!

```
	<head>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
	</head>
```

Note:
"The `link` tag needs two attributes: `rel="stylesheet"` and an `href` attribute.

The `href` attribute value works very similarly to linking to an image, or to another page.


---

##CSS Break Down

```
p {
	color: red;
	font-weight: bold;
}
```
--

##CSS Break Down

This whole thing is called a **rule**.

The `p` is called a **selector**, and it's followed by a set of **declarations** in a **declaration block**.

```
p {
	color: red;
	font-weight: bold;
}
```

--

##CSS Break Down

The **selector**, `p` in this case, specifies what parts of the HTML document should be styled by the declaration. This selector will style all `p` elements on the page.

```
p {
	color: red;
	font-weight: bold;
}
```

--

##CSS Break Down

The **declaration block** here is:

```
{
	color: red;
	font-weight: bold;
}
```

**Declarations** go inside curly braces.

--


##CSS Break Down

#### Declarations

This example has two declarations. Here's the first:

```
color: red;
```

Note:
Every declaration is a **property** followed by a **value**, separated by a colon, ending in a semicolon.

In this declaration, we are setting the `color` **property** to the **value** `red`.


--


##CSS Break Down

Let's look at the second declaration:

```
font-weight: bold;
```

Note:

What style **property** are we specifying here?

What **value** are we setting that **property** to?

Try writing a new set of styles for another element, like an `h1`.


--

##CSS Break Down

Why might we want to link to a separate CSS file?

Note:

Discuss as a class

##CSS Colors

Colors can be specified in CSS in a variety of ways:

![](../img/unit_1/color.png)

Note:
* keyword
* hex codes
* rgb
* hsl
* rgba
* hsla

--

##CSS Colors
###Color Keywords

These are used less frequently, but are handy for `black` and `white`.

See [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) for more

--

##CSS Colors
###Hex Codes (RGB)

![Hex Color explanation](../img/unit_1/hex_colors.png)

Note:
"Hex" values are so-called because they use hexadecimal, or base-16, to describe the color values for red, green, and blue. Each of the 3 color values is expressed by two hexadecimal digits, from `00` (no color) to `FF` (full color), and are written in the order red, green, then blue, after an initial `#` sign.

Hex values can be abbreviated to only 3 digits if each digits is doubled. So `#FFFFFF` (white) can be expressed more succinctly as `#FFF`, and `#000000` (black) can be expressed as `#000`. `#FA6198`, however, cannot be abbreviated without altering the color.

--

##CSS Colors
###RGB Color Values

####```rgb(0,0,0)```

*	The first value is red, the second green, the third blue.

*	Each value can range from 0 to 255, which expresses the same number of color steps as 00 to FF in base-16.


Note:
FF in base-16 is equivalent to 255 in base-10.

In RGB, `rgb(0,0,0)` is black, `rgb(255,255,255)` is white, `rgb(255,0,0)` is red, etc.

White-space is allowed *inside* the parentheses, so `rgb(255, 0, 0)` will do just as well.
</aside>

--

##CSS Colors
###RGBa Colors


*	RGBa works identically to RGB, expect that it takes a 4th value called the "alpha".
*	This is a value between 0 and 1 which will be used to determine a color's opacity on the page


![](../img/unit_1/rgba_color.png)

Note:
0 is completely transparent, and 1 being solid. 0.5 or .5 is 50% opacity.

Thus, __rgba(0,0,0,.25)__ is black at 25% opacity and __rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)__ is white at 80% opacity.

The alpha value can be in decimal form but cannot use a percentage. When a decimal is used, the leading zero is optional.

--

##CSS Colors
###HSL Colors (uncommon)

####HSL
*	Similar notation to RGB values, but specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness.

####HSLa
*	As with RGBa, HSLa is exactly like HSL for the first 3 values, but takes a 4th alpha-channel value.

Note:
**Hue** is expressed as a degree angle measure, with red being at 0, green at 120, and blue at 240. Note that the degree unit is implied, and that the angle wraps around, so 360 also refers to red, and -120 is the same as 240 (blue).

**Saturation** is expressed as a percentage, with 100% being a fully saturated color, and 0% being a shade of gray (no hue).

**Lightness** is also expressed as a percentage, 0% being black, and 100% being white. 50% lightness is the "normal" color range: anything above 50% gives a white tint, anything below 50% gives a black shade.

As an example, red is ```hsl(0, 100%, 50%)```, which is equivalent to ```#FF0000```.

Note that changing the opacity allows whatever colors are "behind" an element to shine through, which can alter the visible color significantly, especially at lower opacities.
